Certainly! Let me provide a concise paraphrase of the given sentence:

"We conducted research on spam filtering techniques for short message service (SMS) based on 
a Kaggle dataset containing 5572 messages. Among these, 4825 were legitimate messages, and 747 were spam. Our approach involved using Bag-of-Words models followed by term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) transformation for feature extraction. We evaluated various classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and neural networks. Surprisingly, even simple linear methods like logistic regression achieved less than 2% misclassification error. Additionally, we explored resampling methods
to address class imbalance and investigated online learning strategies." ðŸ˜Š
